I made an employee management system application designed to manage employee data effectively. It provides features for reading, adding, editing, and deleting employees, along with image uploads. The system is built using the following technologies:
Firstly, I used the JavaScript framework React for the user interface and built the backend with Node.js and Express.js for handling employee data. I have also used a MongoDB database to store employee information, such as unique ID, name, email, mobile number, designation, gender, courses, and uploaded images. I have also used the Multer middleware for handling image uploads, and I used CORS to allow cross-origin requests from the frontendÂ application. write this in 3-4 bullet points and ignore repetative words
